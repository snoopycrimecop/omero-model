## omero-model.properties
## ----------------------
##
## DO NOT EDIT!
##
## This properties file is compiled into omero-model.jar and serves as a default
## for all server-side values (client configuration happens differently).
##
## Any of these properties can be altered by using bin/omero config. MODIFYING
## THIS FILE DOES NOT ALTER SERVER BEHAVIOR. It solely defines the defaults
## at compile time!
##
## For an overview of these properties, see
## https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/omero/sysadmins/config.html
##
## Properties marked with "DEVELOPMENT" should not be used in production.

# to a new major version.
omero.db.version=OMERO5.4

# The patch version of the database which is in use.
# This value need not match the patch version of the

# Default values for the current profile will be
# hard-coded into the hibernate.properties file
# in the `model-*.jar`. By using a different jar,
# you can modify the defaults.

# Note: some other properties are defined in
# the file :file:`etc/profiles/${omero.db.profile}`
# Especially of importance is :property:`omero.db.port`
# Set during the build

# The string that will be used as the base for LSIDs
# in all exported OME objects including OME-XML and
# OME-TIFF. It's usually not necessary to modify this

# Sets the number of database server connections which
# will be used by OMERO.
#
# A sizeable increase in this value, e.g. to 100, will

# to accept *at least* as many, preferably more, connections
# as this value.
#
# The related values omero.threads.max_threads and
# omero.threads.background_threads do *not* need to be
# increased by the same amount. A system will be more stable
# if background_threads is less than max_threads and
# max_threads is less than poolsize.
